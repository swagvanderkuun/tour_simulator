- Dropdown menus for each stage
- Quick and easy for basic configurations

#### 2. Advanced Mode (Mixed Types with Weights)
- Create complex mixed stage profiles
- Weight sliders for each stage type
- Real-time validation and auto-normalization
- Visual feedback for weight totals

### üé® Enhanced User Interface

#### Stage Configuration
- **Expandable sections** for each stage in advanced mode
- **Real-time validation** with visual feedback
- **Auto-normalization** option for invalid weights
- **Quick examples** button for common mixed stages

#### Visual Feedback
- ‚úÖ Success messages for valid configurations
- ‚ùå Error messages for invalid weights
- üìä Live weight total display
- üéØ Current profile summary

### üìä Advanced Analytics

#### Stage Summary
- **Weighted distribution** showing fractional stage counts
- **Mixed stage identification** with stage numbers
- **Interactive pie chart** of stage type distribution
- **Export functionality** for data analysis

#### Export Features
- **CSV export** with stage, type, weight, and value columns
- **Comprehensive data** including all mixed stage combinations
- **Ready for analysis** in external tools

## How to Use

### Accessing Stage Management

1. **Navigate to Stage Types**: Use the sidebar to select "üèÅ Stage Types"
2. **Choose Mode**: Select between Simple and Advanced configuration
3. **Configure Stages**: Set up your desired stage profiles
4. **Apply Changes**: Click "Apply Changes" to save modifications

### Simple Mode Usage

1. **Select Stage Type**: Use dropdown menus for each stage
2. **View Current Selection**: See the current type displayed
3. **Apply Changes**: Save your modifications

### Advanced Mode Usage

1. **Expand Stage Sections**: Click on stage expanders to configure
2. **Set Weights**: Use number inputs to set weights (0.0 to 1.0)
3. **Monitor Total**: Watch the total weight display
4. **Auto-Normalize**: Use the normalize button if weights don't sum to 1.0
5. **View Profile**: See the current mixed profile summary

### Quick Examples

The dashboard includes a "Quick Mix Examples" button that applies common mixed stage configurations:

- **Stage 4**: 60% Punch, 40% Sprint (Hilly Sprint)
- **Stage 8**: 50% Sprint, 30% Punch, 20% Break Away (Complex)
- **Stage 13**: 30% Break Away, 70% Mountain (Mountain with Breakaway)
- **Stage 16**: 80% Mountain, 20% Break Away (Mountain with Opportunities)

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration

The dashboard seamlessly integrates with the new weighted stage profiles system:

```python
# Dashboard imports the new functions
from stage_profiles import (
    StageType, get_stage_profile, validate_stage_profile, 
    update_stage_profile, STAGE_PROFILES
)
```

### Session State Management

The dashboard maintains stage configurations in session state:

```python
if 'stage_profiles_edit' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.stage_profiles_edit = STAGE_PROFILES.copy()
```

### Validation System

Real-time validation ensures data integrity:

```python
# Validate all profiles before applying
invalid_stages = []
for stage_num in range(1, 22):
    profile = st.session_state.stage_profiles_edit.get(stage_num, {StageType.SPRINT: 1.0})
    if isinstance(profile, dict) and not validate_stage_profile(profile):
        invalid_stages.append(stage_num)
```

## User Experience Features
