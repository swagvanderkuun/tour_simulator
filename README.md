## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd tour_simulator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Simulation
```python
from simulator import TourSimulator

# Create and run simulation
simulator = TourSimulator()
simulator.simulate_tour()

# Get results
gc_results = simulator.get_final_gc()
sprint_results = simulator.get_final_sprint()
mountain_results = simulator.get_final_mountain()
```

### Multi-Simulation Analysis
```python
from multi_simulator import run_multi_simulation

# Run 100 simulations
results = run_multi_simulation(100)

# Analyze results
for rider, stats in results.items():
    print(f"{rider}: {stats['mean']:.1f} Â± {stats['std']:.1f} points")
```

### Team Optimization
```python
from team_optimization import TeamOptimizer

# Create optimizer
optimizer = TeamOptimizer(budget=48.0, team_size=20)

# Get expected points
rider_data = optimizer.run_simulation(100)

# Optimize team
team_selection = optimizer.optimize_team(rider_data)

print(f"Optimal team: {team_selection.rider_names}")
print(f"Expected points: {team_selection.expected_points:.1f}")
print(f"Total cost: {team_selection.total_cost:.2f}")
```

## Rider Management

The dashboard includes comprehensive rider management capabilities:

- **View Riders**: Browse all riders with filtering by team, age, and price
- **Edit Riders**: Modify rider parameters (abilities, price, abandon chance)
- **Add Riders**: Create new riders with custom parameters

**Important**: All rider changes made in the dashboard are immediately reflected in subsequent simulations and optimizations. The system maintains a consistent rider database across all operations.

## Data Export

Simulation results can be exported to Excel files containing:
- Stage-by-stage results
- Final classifications
- Rider performance data
- Team optimization results

## Configuration

Key parameters can be adjusted in the respective modules:
- Stage types and points in `simulator.py`
- Optimization constraints in `team_optimization.py`
- Rider parameters in `riders.py`

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly
- PuLP (for optimization)
- OpenPyXL (for Excel export)
